Following https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/ on CSS Modules.

## What are CSS Modules? (Part I)

CSS Modules is not an _official spec_ or an _implementation in the browser_ but rather a process in a build step (webpack or browserify) that changes class names and selectors to be scoped.

But why?

Remember how HTML and CSS normally work.  A class is applied in HTML:

```html
<h1 class="title">My Great Blog Post</h1>
```

Title styled in CSS:

```css
.title {
  background-color: red;
}
```

The browser will turn the background red, no processing required.

For modules though, all of the markup goes into a JS file:

```javascript
import styles from "./styles.css"

element.innerHTML = 
  `<h1 class="${styles.title}">
    No one blogs like me!
  </h1>`;
```

Here a build step would be required which would generate something like this HTML:

```html
<h1 class="_styles__title_309571057">
  More Fun in the Sun This Summer!
<h1>
```

And something like this CSS:
```css
._styles__title_309571057 {
  background-color: red
}
```

This "scopes" the CSS with an entirely new string; the original CSS is not served to the browser at all.  The styles are scoped to particular templates.  

The article then links to [this article](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-css-modules-methodology/), the following of which is in the "understanding-css-modules-methodology" folder in this repo.

But why do this?  Why?  I already asked this question above, but here is the answer, allegedly.

## Why should we use CSS Modules?

Because then we can guarantee that all of the styles for a single component:

1.  Live in one place
2.  Only apply to that component and nothing else

Plus, any component can hava a true dependency, like:

```javascript
import buttons from "./buttons.css";
import padding from "./padding.css";

element.innerHTML = `<div class="${buttons.red} ${padding.large}">`;
```

**Modules fix the problem of the _global scope_ in CSS**
  
Big "have you ever done / wondered / slapped" list here, leading to bad code.

But with CSS Modules everything is in **local scope by default** and so no more bad code!

## The "composes" keyword

Take this CSS:

```css
  .serif-font {
    font-family: Georgia, serif;
  }

  .display {
    composes: serif-font;
    font-size: 30px;
    line-height: 35px;
  }
```

We can declare these classes in our template thusly:

```javascript
import type from "./type.css";

element.innerHTML = 
  `<h1 class ="${type.display}">
    Send More Cops!
  </h1>`
```

Once again giving us a class with a name like:

```html
<h1 class="_type__display_78323472 _type__serif_381763">
  Send More Cops!
<h1>
```

Awesome!  Wait, what?  Why?  Because both classes have been bound to the element by the use of the `composes` keyword, which is so much better than any other way of doing it.  You can even compose in a separate file.

```css
.element {
  composes: dark-red from "./colors.css";
  font-size: 72px;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
```

We don't need to use [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)!  And I'm not going to read about that because I don't know that BEM is. Or, I do, but I've never used it and I don't think it's really used any more anyway.

[And there's so many more great reasons to use modules!](https://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules)

## Getting Started with CSS Modules (Part II)

CSS should never rely on client-side Javascript to work.  Or something.  So let's get into Webpack!

Part II in involves using webpack to create some css that is then "modularized" into styles.css by Webpack.

It's mostly straightforward, except for the use of `MiniCssExtractPlugin`.  I used that instead of `ExtractTextPlugin`, which is deprecated.  The only thing it didn't seem to offer was an `.extract` function which allowed for the customization of the derived class names.  There might still be a way to do that, I don't know!

## React + CSS Modules = üòç (Part III)

In the final post, we will be making a static React site with Webpack's help.  The site will have two templates: a homepage and an about page with a coupe of React components to explain how things work in practice.

One issue: in the tutorial it instructs the user to set the `libraryTarget` to `umd` in `webpack.config.js`.  This results in an error of the window object being undefined.  The solution to this problem was to add the setting `globalObject: this`.
